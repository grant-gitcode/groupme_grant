    <h1>How to set up the extension</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 14px">To set up the extension, you must manually edit the <code>popup.js</code> file. In this file, there will
    be a variable called token at the top of the file. It should initially contain the value <code>"?token="</code>.
    To this, you must append your GroupMe token, so that the variable looks like <code>"?token=mySuperLongToken"</code>.
    That's it!</p>
    <h1>How to use the extension</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 14px">This extension allows the user to easily share links on GroupMe. Press
    Alt+Shift+G when on a webpage which you wish to share. In the pop up window, type the name of the group
    to which you wish to share the link, and enter an optional message to share with the link. Hit enter
    when you're ready, and the link will be shared! It's that simple!</p>
