    when you first download the extension. At that point, you will stay signed in during and between browser
    sessions. If you remove the extension and close your current browser session, you will have to sign in again
    upon downloading the extension again.</p>

    Alt+Shift+G, or click the extension icon, when on a webpage which you wish to share. In the pop up window,
    type the name of the group to which you wish to share the link, and enter an optional message to share
    with the link. Hit enter when you're ready, and the link will be shared! It's that simple!</p>
